# Plant Disease Detection
Plant Disease Detection is a web-based application leveraging React for the frontend and Python (FastAPI, PyTorch) for the backend. It uses an SVM-trained machine learning model to identify plant diseases from images, providing farmers and researchers with accurate, real-time diagnostics for better crop health management.
